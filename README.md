# Melanoma-Detection
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Project Background: Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, accounting for 75% of skin cancer deaths. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment, but manual diagnosis is time-consuming and prone to human error.
- Business Problem: The project aims to build an AI-based melanoma detection system that can classify nine types of skin diseases using deep learning, helping dermatologists improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.
- Dataset: The dataset consists of 2,357 images sourced from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), categorized into nine classes, including melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and other benign/malignant skin conditions.

## Conclusions
- Model Performance & Overfitting: The initial model showed signs of overfitting, with training accuracy significantly higher than validation accuracy. Data augmentation and regularization techniques were applied to mitigate this issue.
- Impact of Class Imbalance: The dataset had an imbalanced class distribution, with some skin conditions having significantly fewer samples. Class rebalancing techniques, such as oversampling and augmentation, improved the modelâ€™s generalization.
- Effectiveness of Data Augmentation: pplying data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zooming, etc.) helped reduce overfitting and improved validation accuracy by making the model more robust to variations in image orientation and lighting.
- Final Model Performance: After implementing optimizations, the final CNN model achieved higher validation accuracy and better generalization. However, further improvements could be made using hyperparameter tuning and deeper architectures.
